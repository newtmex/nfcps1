### INTRO
This is a project I did in the year 2016. The project was done before I started using github to do version control (more acurrately: before I learnt what version control was all about). So I decided to upload this repo so that it will be among the feathers in my cap.

#### INFO
The project was done for the National Fellowship of Christian Pharmacy Students when the headquaters was at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Then I was the ICT/ Media Cordinator. So I was tasked with many ICT/ Media related responsibilities of which building this website was one of them.

The site went live, but did not see more than one year on the internet.

It was hosted @ nfcps.org.ng (you can view it on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160101000000*/nfcps.org.ng) provided by Archive.org).

I did not include the MySql database settings for the site yet. Maybe in subsequent commits (if there will ever be) I will include them.

Here is to saying that 'there was a project done by me!'.
